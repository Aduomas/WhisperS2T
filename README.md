# WhisperS2T ‚ö°

WhisperS2T is an optimized lightning-fast speech-to-text pipeline tailored for the whisper model! It's designed to be exceptionally fast, boasting a 1.5X speed improvement over WhisperX and a 2X speed boost compared to HuggingFace Pipeline with FlashAttention 2 (Insanely Fast Whisper). Moreover, it includes several heuristics to enhance transcription accuracy.

[**Whisper**](https://github.com/openai/whisper) is a general-purpose speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.

## Benchmark and Technical Report

Stay tuned for a technical report comparing WhisperS2T against other whisper pipelines. Meanwhile, check some quick benchmarks on A30 GPU.

## Features

- üîÑ **Multi-Backend Support:** Support for various Whisper model backends including Original OpenAI Model, HuggingFace Model with FlashAttention2, and CTranslate2 Model.
- üéôÔ∏è **Easy Integration of Custom VAD Models:** Seamlessly add custom Voice Activity Detection (VAD) models to enhance control and accuracy in speech recognition.
- üéß **Effortless Handling of Small or Large Audio Files:** Intelligently batch smaller speech segments from various files, ensuring optimal performance.
- ‚è≥ **Streamlined Processing for Large Audio Files:** Asynchronously loads large audio files in the background while transcribing segmented batches, notably reducing loading times.
- üåê **Batching Support with Multiple Language/Task Decoding:** Decode multiple languages or perform both transcription and translation in a single batch for improved versatility and transcription time.
- üß† **Reduction in Hallucination:** Optimized parameters and heuristics to decrease repeated text output or hallucinations.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Dynamic Time Length Support (Experimental):** Process variable-length inputs in a given input batch instead of fixed 30 seconds, providing flexibility and saving computation time during transcription.
