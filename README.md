# WhisperS2T ‚ö°

WhisperS2T is an optimized lightning-fast speech-to-text pipeline tailored for the whisper model! It's designed to be exceptionally fast, boasting a 1.5X speed improvement over WhisperX and a 2X speed boost compared to HuggingFace Pipeline with FlashAttention 2 (Insanely Fast Whisper). Moreover, it includes several heuristics to enhance transcription accuracy.

[**Whisper**](https://github.com/openai/whisper) is a general-purpose speech recognition model developed by OpenAI. It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification.

## Benchmark and Technical Report

Stay tuned for a technical report comparing WhisperS2T against other whisper pipelines. Meanwhile, check some quick benchmarks on A30 GPU.

## Features

- üîÑ **Multi-Backend Support:** Support for various Whisper model backends including Original OpenAI Model, HuggingFace Model with FlashAttention2, and CTranslate2 Model.
- üéôÔ∏è **Easy Integration of Custom VAD Models:** Seamlessly add custom Voice Activity Detection (VAD) models to enhance control and accuracy in speech recognition.
- üéß **Effortless Handling of Small or Large Audio Files:** Intelligently batch smaller speech segments from various files, ensuring optimal performance.
- ‚è≥ **Streamlined Processing for Large Audio Files:** Asynchronously loads large audio files in the background while transcribing segmented batches, notably reducing loading times.
- üåê **Batching Support with Multiple Language/Task Decoding:** Decode multiple languages or perform both transcription and translation in a single batch for improved versatility and transcription time. (Best support with CTranslate2 backend)
- üß† **Reduction in Hallucination:** Optimized parameters and heuristics to decrease repeated text output or hallucinations. (Some heuristics works only with CTranslate2 backend)
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Dynamic Time Length Support (Experimental):** Process variable-length inputs in a given input batch instead of fixed 30 seconds, providing flexibility and saving computation time during transcription. (Only with CTranslate2 backend)



## Getting Started

### Installation

Install audio packages required for resampling and loading audio files.

```sh
apt-get install -y libsndfile1 ffmpeg
```

To install or update to the latest released version of WhisperS2T use the following command:

```sh
pip install -U whisper-s2t
```

Or to install from latest commit in this repo:

```sh
pip install -U git+https://github.com/shashikg/WhisperS2T.git
```

### Usage

```py
import whisper_s2t

model = whisper_s2t.load_model(model_identifier="large-v2", backend='CTranslate2')

files = ['data/KINCAID46/audio/1.wav']
lang_codes = ['en']
tasks = ['transcribe']
initial_prompts = [None]

out = model.transcribe_with_vad(files,
                                lang_codes=lang_codes,
                                tasks=tasks,
                                initial_prompts=initial_prompts,
                                batch_size=32)

print(out[0][0])
